                        Social media, news portals and blogs are some of the most important
                        institutions of a modern society. However, they are also the hotspots of disemination of fake news.
                        Our application is machine learning based web application for the ICT Division, under the
                        Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Bangladesh. Our goal is to perform real
                        time analysis on any textual data from social media, news media and blog.
                        We developed a novel, cutting-edge, scalable data engineering machine learning algorithms
                        that utilizes existing data sources to present statistical analytic content, and
                        extract data insights across different platforms. This allows us to monitor fake content on the internet and
                        and take preemptive decisions to create a better and more social environment on the internet.
